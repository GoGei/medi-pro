# Admin Loggers (Admin Panel)

---

## User Story: View System Logs

### As an
Administrator with "logger" access level

### I want to
View logs of administrative actions and integrations

### So that
I can audit actions, trace changes, and monitor data sync activities

---

## Description

The **Logger** section in the admin panel contains two read-only logging pages:
- `Admin Logger`
- `Integrations`

These sections are only accessible to users with the `logger` permission level.

## Admin Logger

Tracks actions taken by admin users across the system. It includes both:
- **Administrative actions** (who did what and when)
- **General logs** related to system behavior and activity

### Table View:
- Timestamp
- User
- Action type
- Target object (if applicable)
- Description / Notes

### Detail View:
Displays full information from the log entry, including:
- All metadata fields
- Any extended descriptions, diffs, or payloads (if applicable)

All entries are **read-only**.

---

## Integrations

Tracks when and by whom integrations were performed.

### Table Columns:
- Performed by (User)
- Timestamp
- Target model / dictionary

No detail view is provided â€” information is available **only in the table**.
