## User Story: View and Manage Appointments in Calendar

### As a
Clinic Employee or Owner

### I want to
View appointments in a calendar format

### So that
I can easily understand scheduling and availability by day and week

## Description

The calendar displays appointments with the following behavior:

### Appointment visibility:
- Only appointments with status `new` or `done` are shown.
- Appointments with status `cancelled` are excluded from the calendar and shown on a **separate page**.

### View modes:
- **Week view**: Displays appointments for **all doctors** from **Monday to Sunday**.
- **Day view**: Each column represents a **separate doctor**, showing their appointments for the selected day.

### UI behavior:
- Time slots that are **outside of working hours** (defined by both `branch` and `employee`) are **shaded in grey**.
- Calendar includes two filters:
  - `branch` filter
  - `employee` filter

- A button labeled **Add** opens a modal or popup for **adding a new appointment**.
